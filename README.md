# eu_efficiency_figtabs
R-Code to replicate the figures and tables of the EU's energy efficiency

This R-script allows the user to replicate the figures and tables of the paper "Energy footprints and the international trade network: A new dataset.
Is the European Union doing it better?" co-authored by Patrick Tomberger (patrick.tomberger@wti.org), Octavio Fern√°ndez-Amador, Joseph F. Francois and Doris A. Oberdabernig.
